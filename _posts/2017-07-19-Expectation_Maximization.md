title: Unsupervised Learning - Expectation Maximization

{% include math.html %}

Expectation Maximization is a popular generative algorithm, which elegantly handles Multi-Variate Distributions and tries to find close approximations to underlying data-generating distribution.  

For fun, I derived the Multi-Variate Expectation Maximization algorithm, using Mixture of Gaussians. [Interested readers can find it here](https://yogeshluthra.github.io/Expectation_Maximization_Derivation)

In following I will consider a particular family of exponential distributions, the Normal Distribution, which for 1-dimensional data x:  
$$N(x_{n} | \mu_{k}, \sigma^2_{k}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.\pi.\sigma_{k}^2}} . e^\frac{-(x_{n}-\mu_{k})^2}{2.\sigma_{k}^2}$$  
(subscripts $$n \in \{1,2,...N\}\ and\ k \in \{1,2,...K\}$$ are for N data points and K Normal Distributions which try to approximate data distribution.  
For multidimensional data (s.t. $$x_{n}\in \mathbb{R}^D$$), Normal Distribution is,  
$$N(x_{n} |  \mu_{k}, \Sigma_{k}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{det(2.\pi.\Sigma_{k})}}.e^\frac{-(x_{n}-\mu_{k})^T.\Sigma_{k}^{-1}.(x_{n}-\mu_{k})}{2}$$  
where $$\Sigma_{k}$$ is covariance matrix for  $$distribution_{k}$$ (or $$cluster_{k}$$)  

For following discussion, we will mainly consider 1-dimensional data x (start from something simple and grow complex!)  

## EM Algorithm looks like this:  
Repeat until convergence:  
- find
$$\gamma_{nk}=\frac{\pi_{k}.N(x_{n}|\mu_{k},\sigma_{k}^2)}{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\pi_{k}.N(x_{n}|\mu_{k},\sigma_{k}^2)}$$  
(Can be interpretted as probability of $$distribution_{k}$$ (or $$cluster_{k}$$), given data point $$x_{n}$$ is observed.)  

- find
$$N_{k}=\sum_{n=1}^{N} \gamma_{nk}$$  
(Can be interpreted as Expected number of data points which belong to $$distribution_{k}$$ (or $$cluster_{k}$$)  

- find
$$\pi_{k}=\frac{N_{k}}{N}$$  
(updated prior of the $$distribution_{k}$$ (or $$cluster_{k}$$))  

- find
$$\mu_{k}=\frac{\sum_{n=1}^{N} \gamma_{nk}.x_{n}}{N_{k}}$$  
(weighted mean of $$distribution_{k}$$ (or $$cluster_{k}$$))

- find
$$\Sigma_{k}=\frac{\sum_{n=1}^{N} \gamma_{nk}.(x_{n}-\mu_{k})(x_{n}-\mu_{k})^T}{N_{k}}$$ ...[1]

Now lets see this algorithm fitting 5-Gaussians (K=5) on a gray-scale image shown below. Size of this image=300KB  
![alt text]({{site.url}}/images/road.png "Road"){:height="200px" width="200px"}  
\\
After running EM algorithm on this image, trying to 5-Gaussians, we get following compressed image=100KB  
(Note that actual storage size on disk < 10KB, as this image is actually stored as:  
1. an array of 8 bit integers, each location specifying which cluster it belongs to (that is, most likely Gaussian for that data point).  
2. And only 15 64-bit floating point numbers, with 5 for $$\pi$$, 5 for $$\mu$$, 5 for $$\sigma^2$$.)

\\
Following is the statistical analysis of what original image distribution was, how 5-Gaussians were fitted and distribution after sub-sampling to prove that only few unique values are sufficient to describe the compressed image.

\\
As seen above, 5-Gaussians fit (Red dotted line in top half) matches closely to actual data distribution. But is of-course a smoothed approximation.  
Bottom-half in picture above compares histogram of sub-sampled image (each pixel value replace with most likely Gaussian), and histogram of original image.

#### [1]: it is important to interpret $$(x_{n}-\mu_{k})(x_{n}-\mu_{k})^T$$  
Let us say $$x_i \in \mathbb{R}^D$$ (and of course also $$\mu_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^D$$)
So,
$$\begin{bmatrix}
x_{i1}-\mu_{k1}\\
x_{i2}-\mu_{k2}\\
...\\
x_{iD}-\mu_{kD}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\times
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{i1}-\mu_{k1} & x_{i2}-\mu_{k2} & ... & x_{iD}-\mu_{kD}\\
\end{bmatrix}$$  
$$=\\
\begin{bmatrix}(x_{i1}-\mu_{k1})^2 & (x_{i1}-\mu_{k1})*(x_{i2}-\mu_{k2}) & ... & (x_{i1}-\mu_{k1})*(x_{iD}-\mu_{kD})\\
(x_{i2}-\mu_{k2})*(x_{i1}-\mu_{k1}) & (x_{i2}-\mu_{k2})^2 & ... & (x_{i2}-\mu_{k2})*(x_{iD}-\mu_{kD})\\
...\\
(x_{iD}-\mu_{kD})*(x_{i1}-\mu_{k1}) & (x_{iD}-\mu_{kD})*(x_{i2}-\mu_{k2}) & ... & (x_{iD}-\mu_{kD})^2\\
\end{bmatrix}$$
