# How to evaluate a Classifier using ROC curves

For classification tasks, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Area Under Curve (AUC) are important concepts to know. At times, I have seen people unclear about these concepts and hence my effort to explain these.

## Why is this important?

Imagine a dataset repesenting 2 classes but highly skewed, say 90%-10% for positive-negative labels. On such dataset, even a random classifier could be 90% accurate.
- How do we evaluate or rank various classifiers performance on such dataset?

Now imagine a multi-class dataset with 100 classes, and there are few classes which makeup up <1% in this set.
- How do we know which of these rare classes are being mis-predicted?
There may be classifiers which probably have lower accuracy than others but may do a good job in correctly classifying such hard examples.
- Would you prefer those?
- How would you trade-off accuracy VS correct-prediction of some of these rare classes.

Answering these questions require some interpretation of how well a classifier has separated different classes.

## Receiver Operating Characteristic basics.

(For purpose of illustrations, I will mainly assume that classifier learns a gaussian distribution for classes, although following analysis can be extended to any distribution. A $$ GaussianPDF(mean, std) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2*\pi*std^2}} * e^{\frac{-1}{2} * (\frac{x-mean}{std})^2} $$)

Wikipedia describes ROC as: “In statistics, a receiver operating characteristic curve, i.e. ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.”

Discrimination threshold is also sometimes called the Decision Boundary, the meaning of which is as follows.
